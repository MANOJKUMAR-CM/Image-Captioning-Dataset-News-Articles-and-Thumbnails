# Image Captioning Dataset: News Articles and Thumbnails
This project focuses on building a pipeline to extract **news headlines** and their associated **thumbnails** from a news website. The extracted images and headlines are saved in a **PostgreSQL database**, and the entire process is logged for debugging and automation purposes. The dataset can be used for tasks like **image captioning** and **text-image associations**.
